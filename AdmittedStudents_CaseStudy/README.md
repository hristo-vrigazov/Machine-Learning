# CEO case study
Coursera course case study:
You have a data about students result at tests and whether they got admitted in university. What we have here is a simple implementation
of logistic regression to make predictions about new students.
To run this example, type 'ex2' in Matlab/Octave after you have changed your directory to where you have cloned the repository.
